Finished PCB!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have now finished my PCB and fully uploaded it to JLCPCB. This was an incredibly fun journey from learning a new CAD software to meeting amazing people on lock-in calls.
Some challenges I faced:
-Learning a new CAD software (Surprisingly, OnShape doesn't carry over to KiCAD)
-My PC sometimes struggles to run KiCAD, causing delays in my process
-Learning how to route wires, especially after adding the RGB LED, without planning ahead
-Exporting the files to JLCPCB posed quite a challenge after the CSV files got messed up in download, but eventually I got it figured out through trial and error (and a lot of spreadsheets)

Some ups in my journey:
-Despite the challenges that come with a new program, it was quite fun to dive into PCB making for the first time.
-Meeting people on lock-in calls, and finding people I could relate to
-Just getting to have fun and begin my Hack Club journey

I can't wait to see where this goes and maybe even attend Prototype!

Adding Decals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I added decals to my board. I used the guided project, along with external resources I found on YouTube, to help import drawings. I also colored over the blueprint logo through Canva to get it on the back of my board. I added my name and a custom drawing to emulate a blueprint-type design on the bottom of the board.

Finishing the Wiring
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wiring is complete! Everything is grounded and has power. I also altered the board to include an RGB light at the bottom. This took many headaches, including making sure the data lines were the same length and routing lines from the RGB all the way up to the VBUS.

Starting the PCB
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My start to the PCB was rough. I had a few issues finding the correct footprint for the memory and power. I reached out to some other hack club members, and they were able to swiftly walk me through the issues and fix them. So far, I am having a very fun time designing and editing through KiCAD and learning a whole new skill. I have attached an image of my progress on the PCB. I also started to understand what the blue lines mean and how to place the capacitors and resistors correctly without a guide.

Finished With Schematics!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've just finished the schematics for the board! I finished while on the lock-in call, and many people, like Jay, were able to assist with my questions. A few of these were: how to organize my board, and fixing the ERC issues I was having. So far, this has been very fun, but I was told the hard part comes next, so I'm excited to see what it's like!

New Learning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have started my DevBoard with the tutorial! So far, I have completed up to the crystal oscillator. Some things I have learned are:
-Many of the keybinds for wiring, placing, etc.
-How to quickly place wires instead of hitting W every time
-many of the notations that come with circuitry
I had to work through a couple of issues, including misreading steps and my KiCAD crashing, but I have powered through. I have attached an image of my progress after one hour

Getting a foothold!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am very well versed in traditional CAD programs, and have worked with 3d printing before, but this is my first time creating a PCB! I have downloaded KiCad and am ready to start working.
