In this project, I worked on a Dev Board, following the guided project created by Kai Pereira. Through these instructions, I learn how to use KiCAD, a new program to me. This repository includes the files of the 
finished PCB. The final production shows my ability to not only produce a finalized design, but also modify it in such a way that it demonstrates my learning. 

Overview:
I began this project with the provided instructions on how to create a Dev Board. Through these instructions, I learned the fundamentals of KiCAD and began my journey of designing a PCB. Using the guide,
I recreated the schematic and PCB. 
The parts of the PCB include:
1. USB-C port
2. Flash Memory
3. Crystal Oscillator
4. 1/0 Headers
5. RP2040
6. RGB Light
7. Custom Silk Screen

Program: 
To create this Dev Board, I used KiCAD! This was my first time using KiCAD, and it was a nice introduction. For the silk screen, I used Excalidraw to draw the bottom and the top of the PCB. To produce the PCB, I used JLCPCB.
